# RAPIDSNPs: A new computational pipeline for rapidly identifying key genetic variants reveals previously unidentified SNPs that are significantly associated with individual platelet responses

RAPIDSNPs is a pipeline for idenifying key snps associated with continues phenotypic genetic association data. The pipeline was tested using platelet response under activation adenosine diphosphate and colagen-related cross-linked agonists.
